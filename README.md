## My process

### What I learned

This is not really my first interaction with react, I have already researched and performed certain tests with this library, however I had never done it in such an extensive way as taught in this section of the course, I have taken my time and have repeated the reading of this level several times trying to understand as best as I can the fundamentals of react and the logic involved in programming in it.
